title: Linux Reversing easy challenges
---

What's the best way to get better at something? Trial and error, this blog will be dedicated to me improving upon my RE skillset, and to hopefully provide a good guide for others wanting to learn RE.

### Crackme's

Crackme's are a fun way to learn to RE. They are binaries that are made in such a way to teach you something new or to hone your RE skills.
Head on over to the [https://crackmes.one/](https://crackmes.one/) website for a list of crackmes.


### Downloading all the easy Linux challenges

I'm more familiar with Linux RE than I am with anything else. For me this is where I am starting. Instead of downloading each challenge one by one, I'm going to walk through a script I'm going to use to download all the easy Linux crackmes.
